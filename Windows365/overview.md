# What is Windows 365?

Windows 365 Enterprise is a cloud-based service that automatically creates a new type of Windows virtual machine (Cloud PCs) for your end users. Each Cloud PC is assigned to an individual user and is their dedicated Windows device. Windows 365 provides the productivity, security, and collaboration benefits of Microsoft 365.

Windows 365 is available in two editions:

- **Windows 365 Business** is made specifically for use in smaller companies (up to 300 seats) who want ready-to-use Cloud PCs with simple management options. For more information, see [Getting started with Windows 365 Business and Cloud PCs](business/get-started-windows-365-business.md).
- **Windows 365 Enterprise** is for larger companies who want unlimited seats for creating Cloud PCs. It includes options to create custom Cloud PCs based on device images that you create, more management options, and full integration with Microsoft Endpoint Manager. For more information, see [What is Windows 365 Enterprise?](/enterprise/overview.md).

To learn about the differences between the two versions, see [Compare Windows 365 Business and Enterprise](business-enterprise-comparison.md).

## What is a Cloud PC?

A Cloud PC is a highly available, optimized, and scalable virtual machine providing end users with a rich Windows desktop experience. It’s hosted in the Windows 365 service and is accessible from anywhere, on any device.

End users have a 1:1 relationship with their Cloud PC. It’s their own personal PC in the cloud. Users can connect to their Cloud PC by using [windows365.microsoft.com](https://windows365.microsoft.com/). [Browser and app-based access](./enterprise/end-user-access-cloud-pc.md) is available for Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android devices.

### Creating a Cloud PC

Cloud PCs are created automatically by the Windows 365 service when an end user in an appropriate Azure AD user group is assigned a Windows 365 license.

Admins don't manually create Cloud PCs.

## Billing

Cloud PCs are billed in a per-user per-month cost model. This model means your organization doesn’t have to manage the variability of compute and storage costs of a traditional hosted desktop model.

## Microsoft 365 Lighthouse

Managed Server Providers (MSPs) can manage Cloud PCs in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse for their customer tenants. For more information, see [Windows 365 (Cloud PCs) page overview](/microsoft-365/lighthouse/m365-lighthouse-win365-page-overview).
