# Edit provisioning policies

You can update provisioning policies to change assignments or key attributes, like Image and Network Connection.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/), select **Devices** > **Windows 365** (under **Provisioning**) > **Provisioning policie**s > select a policy.
2. On the policy page, you can edit the **General** information, **Image**, and **Assignments** by selecting **Edit** next to each header.

If you change the on-premises network connection or image in a provisioning policy, no change will occur for previously provisioned Cloud PC's. Newly provisioned Cloud PC's will honor the changes in your provisioning policy. To change the previously provisioned Cloud PC's to align with the changes, you must reprovision these Cloud PC's. 

If you edit the name of the provisioning policy in the General information, the following will occur:

- Any Cloud PC in the All Cloud PCs node will have the new policy name updated in the Provisioning policy column
- New Cloud PCs created from the provisioning policy will have the new name registered as the deviceâ€™s enrollmentProfileName in Azure Active Directory and Microsoft Intune. The enrollmentProfileName property for existing Cloud PCs will not change. If you followed the steps to create a dynamic device group containing all Cloud PCs from a specific provisioning policy, edit the dynamic device group and add a new rule so that the group contains both the existing Cloud PCs and any new Cloud PCs from the provisioning policy:

  - **Property** = enrollmentProfileName
  - **Operator** = Equals
  - **Value** = \<New name for provisioning policy\>

If you assign new users to the provisioning policy, and these users have a valid Cloud PC license, provisioning will automatically occur. If you remove users from the provisioning policy assignment, grade period will be triggered.
