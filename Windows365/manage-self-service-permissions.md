# Manage self-service permissions

Users with self-service upgrade permissions can upgrade Cloud PC performance and storage without admin approval. This doesn't add any additional costs to your organization.

To grant a group self-service upgrades permission, add the group to the **applicable group(s)** list and make sure the **Self-service upgrades permission radio** button is **On**.

You can turn the **Self-service upgrades permission** radio button to **Off** to temporarily revoke self-service but still maintain the list of groups for when you want to turn it on again.

To remove a groupâ€™s permission, delete the group from the **applicable group(s)** list.
