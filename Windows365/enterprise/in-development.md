- If we anticipate that you'll need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, the feature description will move from this page to [What's new](whats-new.md).
- This page and the [What's new](whats-new.md) page are updated periodically. Check back for more updates.
- Similar features may be announced at different times for Windows 365 Business.

### Windows 365 support for RDP Shortpath with TURN<!--43602619-->

In a future update, Windows 365 will support Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) for use with RDP Shortpath. TURN is a popular standard for device-to-device networking for low latency, high-throughput data transmission with Azure Communication Services. For more information about TURN and Azure Communication Services, see [Network Traversal Concepts](/azure/communication-services/concepts/network-traversal). For more information about RDP Shortpath, see [Use RDP Shortpath for public networks with Windows 365](rdp-shortpath-public-networks.md).

### Move Cloud PC<!--43450234-->

Today, when changing the region definition or Azure network connection (ANC) in a provisioning policy, only newly provisioned Cloud PCs are created in the new region. Existing Cloud PCs remain in the original region or ANC.

In a future release, a new option will be added to provisioning policies. This new option will let you define a new region or ANC for the provisioning policy, and trigger existing Cloud PCs to move to the updated region. When you initiate the move:

1. All Cloud PCs in the provisioning policy that no longer match the updated region or ANC will be shut down.
2. All such Cloud PCs will be moved to the new region or ANC.

It may take several hours for the moves to complete.

New Cloud PCs created by the provisioning policy will be created in the new region or ANC.

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Device provisioning

### Cloud PC custom name template<!--42947813-->

Youâ€™ll be able to create a template to automatically create unique names for new Cloud PCs.

<!--***********************************************-->
## End user experience

### Windows 365 app: pin Cloud PC to task bar<!--43470782-->

End users will be able to pin their Cloud PC to the task bar in the Windows 365 app. This will let them launch the Cloud PC from the task bar icon without going into the connection center.

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Monitor and troubleshoot

### End user manual connectivity check<!--37679345 -->

End users will be able to manually run connectivity checks on their Cloud PCs from [windows365.microsoft.com](https://windows365.microsoft.com).

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Miscellaneous

### FQDN tags <!--43488376-->

In a future update, FQDN tags will be available to help customers simplify the creation and maintenance of the necessary rules for outbound network traffic through Azure firewalls.
