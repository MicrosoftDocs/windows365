# In development for Windows 365 Enterprise

To help in your readiness and planning, this page lists Windows 365 updates and features that are in development but not yet released. In addition to the information on this page:

- If we anticipate that you'll need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, the feature description will move from this page to [What's new](whats-new.md).
- This page and the [What's new](whats-new.md) page are updated periodically. Check back for more updates.
- Similar features may be announced at different times for Windows 365 Business.

> [!NOTE]
> This page reflects our current expectations about Windows 365 capabilities in an upcoming release. Dates and individual features might change. This page doesn't describe all features in development.

## App management

### Use conditional access to group Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop app policies together <!-- 36360788 -->

In a future update, you’ll be able to target Conditional Access (CA) policies to a single application that applies to both the Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop apps.

Currently, Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop share a common framework for identity access by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and security controls with CA policies. You can target CA policies to the Windows 365 app and this applies only to windows365.microsoft.com web client. To apply CA policies to the full Windows client and non-windows clients, you must assign CA policies to both the Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop apps.  For more information, see [Assign a Conditional Access policy for Cloud PCs](set-conditional-access-policies.md).

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Device management

### New remote action: remote help<!--38310389-->

The upcoming Remote Help remote action (in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center) will let admins start a remote session into an end user’s Cloud PC.

### Upload a custom image without an on-premises network connection<!--8341750-->

Customers using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Join without bringing an Azure virtual network will be able to upload custom images directly on the image tab in Microsoft Endpoint Manager. Previously, to upload an image, customers needed to create an OPNC for the destination Azure subscription which provides the image.

### windows365.microsoft.com will move to general availability<!--38195529-->

The windows365.microsoft.com web client will be moving out of preview and into general availability.

### Nested virtualization<!--37800910-->

In a future release, for most currently supported regions, Windows 365 8vCPU/32GB licenses will support nested virtualizations for different developer scenarios to use systems like WSL/Hyper-V. Southeast Asia and West US 2 will follow at a later date.

### Operating system end of support status for Cloud PCs<!--36852572 -->

The **Provisioning policies** page is getting a new column: **Image status**. It tells you if the device image for each provisioning policy uses an operating system (OS) that is supported by Microsoft Windows security and other updates.

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Monitor and troubleshoot

### End-user error log collection<!--38195529-->

End users will be able to collect error logs.

### End-user feedback<!--38195529-->

End users will be able to provide feedback to Microsoft from within the Windows 365 web client.

### End user manual connectivity check<!--37679345 -->

End users will be able to manually run connectivity checks on their Cloud PCs from [windows365.microsoft.com](https://windows365.microsoft.com).

### Device history report – new information for Cloud PC performance<!--38310774  -->

The device history report will have new information to help you evaluate Cloud PC performance:

- Top 5 processes impacting CPU spike times
- Top 5 processes impacting RAM spike times
