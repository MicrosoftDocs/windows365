# Alerts in Windows 365

The Windows 365 Alerts system notifies you when specific events occur in your Cloud PC environment, like connection, provisioning, or image upload failures. By default, these alerts appear in the Microsoft Intune admin center as pop-up notifications (you can also turn on email notifications). You can customize the built-in alert rules:

- Set conditions and thresholds for triggering alerts.
- Define the severity of alerts.
- Turn each alert rule on or off.
- Configure each alert to notify you in the console and/or by email.

## View alerts

To view the list of recent alerts, sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Tenant administration** > **Alerts**.

### Filters

By default, only active alerts are shown. You can use the **Add filter** option to filter by:

- Severity
  - Informational
  - Warning
  - Critical
- State
  - Active
  - Resolved
  
### Alert details

You can select an alert from the list to see the details of that alert. 

## Customize alert rule

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Tenant administration** > **Alerts** > **Alert rules**.
