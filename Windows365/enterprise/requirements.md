# Requirements for Windows 365

To use Cloud PCs, you must meet the following requirements:

## Azure requirements

### [Windows 365 Enterprise and Frontline](#tab/enterprise)

None, if you plan on provisioning Azure AD joined Cloud PCs on a Microsoft hosted network.

If you choose to provision Cloud PCs on your own network, an active Azure subscription with the following configurations is required:

- Sufficient permissions to grant Windows 365:
  - A reader role on the subscription.
  - Network contributor permissions on the resource group.
  - A network contributor role on the vNet.

### [Windows 365 Government](#tab/government)

All of the Windows 365 Enterprise requirements apply with the following additions.

A subscription in Azure Government is required for Windows 365 Government customers who would like to use any of the following capabilities:

- Hybrid AADJ
- AADJ and with the customer providing their own network
- Custom Images

## Azure Active Directory and Intune requirements

- A valid and working Intune and Azure Active Directory tenant.
- Ensure that Intune device type enrollment restrictions are set to Allow Windows (MDM) platform for corporate enrollment.
- Infrastructure configuration: If you plan on provisioning Hybrid Azure AD joined Cloud PCs, you must configure your infrastructure to automatically hybrid Azure AD join any devices that domain join to the on-premises Active Directory. This [configuration lets them be recognized and managed in the cloud](/azure/active-directory/devices/overview).
- Azure Active Directory Domain Services isn't supported because it doesn't support Hybrid Azure AD join.

## Domain requirements

None, if you plan on provisioning Azure AD joined Cloud PCs on a Microsoft hosted network.

If you choose to provision Hybrid Azure AD joined Cloud PCs, then the following configurations on your domain are required:

- If an organizational unit is specified, ensure it exists and is valid.
- An Active Directory user account with sufficient permissions to join the computer into the specified organizational unit within the Active Directory domain. If you don't specify an organizational unit, the user account must have sufficient permissions to join the computer to the Active Directory domain.
- User accounts that are assigned Cloud PCs must have a synced identity available in both Active Directory and Azure Active Directory.

> [!NOTE]
> For the user account used to join the Cloud PCs to the Active Directory domain services, make sure to set up appropriate delegation following the instructions in [Increase the computer account limit in the Organizational Unit](/mem/autopilot/windows-autopilot-hybrid#increase-the-computer-account-limit-in-the-organizational-unit).

## Licensing requirements

- You must have an Intune license to use Intune to manage the devices.
- Windows 365 Enterprise: Users must have licenses for Windows E3, Intune, Azure AD P1, and Windows 365 to use their Cloud PC.
- Windows 365 Frontline: Users must
  - Have licenses for Windows E3, Intune, Azure AD P1.
  - Be added to the Azure AD security group in the provisioning policy to use their Cloud PC.

## Management requirements

- You must use [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/) to manage your Cloud PCs.
- You must have a Windows 365 Enterprise or Frontline license to manage Cloud PC configurations.

## Role and identity requirements

- Admin role: You must be an [Intune Administrator in Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#intune-administrator) or [Windows 365 Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference) to provision Cloud PCs.
- User identity: Cloud PC users must be configured with [hybrid identities](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-hybrid-identity) so that they can authenticate with resources both on-premises and in the cloud.

## Supported Azure regions for Cloud PC provisioning

### [Windows 365 Enterprise and Frontline](#tab/ent)

Windows 365 manages the capacity and availability of underlying Azure resources as part of the service. Windows 365 partners closely with Azure to select regions that meet our Windows 365 service requirements for availability and capacity. On availability, we use features like availability zones in Azure to provide in-region resiliency as built-in value to the service. You can create a virtual network or use the Microsoft hosted network for provisioning Cloud PCs in the following Azure regions:

- Asia
  - East Asia
  - Southeast Asia
- Australia
  - Australia East
