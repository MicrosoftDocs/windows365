# Cloud PC utilization report (preview)

The Cloud PC utilization report helps you make sure that your licenses are assigned to active users. By reviewing Cloud PCs with low usage, you can decide if a Windows 365 license would better serve other users who might use these resources more often.

## Use the Cloud PC utilization report

To get to the **Cloud PC utilization** report, sign in to [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select **Devices** > **Cloud PC performance (preview)** > **View report** (under **Cloud PCs with low utilization**).

## All Cloud PCs tab

On the **All Cloud PCs** tab, the report shows the following data aggregated for the last 28 days:

- This histogram shows user connection time in three sections:
  - **High time connected**: More than 80 hours.
  - **Average time connected**: 40-80 hours.
  - **Low time connected**: Less than 40 hours.
  - **No active time connected**: Zero hours.
- List of individual Cloud PCs with the following columns:
  - **Device name**
  - **Primary user UPN**
  - **Total time connected**: The total hours that the user has been connected to the Cloud PC over the last 28 days.
  - **Days since last sign in**

You can use the filter options to see only data for a specific usage group.

## Frontline Cloud PCs tab

This report helps you:

- Understand the number of concurrent connections for each Cloud PC size.
- Make sure you have purchased the right number of licenses for your peak usage.

By reviewing the maximum concurrent connections, you can decide if you need to purchase more licenses to ensure your end users aren't blocked from using their Frontline Cloud PCs.

### Requirements

The following permissions are required to view this report:

- SharedUseLicenseUsageReport
- SharedUseServicePlans

To assign these permissions, go to **Tenant administration** > **Roles** > **Create** > **Windows 365 role**.

### Report data

On the **Frontline Cloud PCs** tab, the report shows the following data aggregated for the last 28 days:

- Number of currently connected Frontline Cloud PCs.
- Maximum number of connected Frontline Cloud PCs for each day in the filtered range (7 or 28 days).
- Maximum concurrency limit.
- Warnings for approaching and reaching the maximum concurrency limit.

You can use the filter to switch between the Cloud PC sizes you have purchased.

This report is specific to Windows 365 Frontline and doesn't apply to other Windows 365 plans. If no Windows 365 Frontline licenses have been purchased on your tenant, no data is in the report.

## Other reports

You can see similar utilization data on a per-Cloud PC basis:

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Devices** > **All Devices**.
2. Select a device and then select **Performance (preview)**.
3. You'll see **Time connected to device**. Under this chart, select **View report** to see more utilization data specific to this Cloud PC.
