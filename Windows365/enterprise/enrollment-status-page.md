# Use the Enrollment Status Page with Cloud PCs

When a user signs in to a device for the first time, the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) displays the Intune provisioning status. Windows 365 supports the ESP which provides a common experience for users who sign into their physical and Cloud PCs for the first time.  For full information about the ESP, see [Set up the Enrollment Status Page]( /mem/intune/enrollment/windows-enrollment-status).

## Windows 365 and the ESP process

When a Cloud PC is provisioned, the Windows 365 service:

1. Creates of Cloud PC.
2. Enrolls the Cloud PC in Intune.
3. Waits for the user to sign in to the new Cloud PC for the first time.
    - While waiting, the Cloud PC:
        - Continues to perform a sync action to request MEM policy.
        - Performs background actions that are device targeted.
4. After the user signs in for the first time, the Cloud PC performs user targeted installations and configurations.
    - If ESP is enabled, the **Account setup** phase of ESP is shown to the user. (The **Device setup** phase is not supported for Cloud PCs. It only occurs during Autopilot in OOBE.)

## Targeting ESP proviles in Windows 365

Windows 365 uses a userless enrolment process. There is no pre-registering of resources as used in the Autopilot. Because the ESP profile is set during enrollment, the grouping and targeting is time sensitive. For this reason, using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) dynamic groups for targeting the ESP profile isnâ€™t not supported.

The only way for targeting ESP profiles in Windows 365 is by using the **All devices** built-in virtual group.

You can also use the **enrollmentProfileName (Enrollment profile name)** property to apply filters for additional targeting granularity. For more information, see [Create a filter for all Cloud PCs from a specific provisioning policy](create-filter.md#create-a-filter-for-all-cloud-pcs-from-a-specific-provisioning-policy).

Both the **All devices** and **enrollmentProfileName** property filter are supported for both Hybrid Azure AD join and Azure AD join identity types. For more information, see [Device join types](/windows-365/enterprise/identity-authentication#device-join-types).
