# What is Windows 365 Frontline?

Windows 365 Frontline is a version of [Windows 365](../overview.md) that helps organizations save costs by providing a single license to provision three Cloud PC virtual machines. For each Windows 365 Frontline license that you buy, you can provision three different Cloud PCs that can’t be used concurrently. Instead, each user receives a unique Cloud PC that they can use when the other two users on the same license aren’t signed into their Cloud PCs.

Windows 365 Frontline is designed specifically for workers who share computing resources and don't require 24/7 dedicated Cloud PCs. This system better supports organizations that are more elastic and distributed working across various of devices. Frontline Cloud PCs can be helpful for users who are:

- On a rotation schedule.
- Working across time zones and regions.
- Part-time workers.
- Contingent staff.

The maximum number of active Windows 365 Frontline Cloud PCs in your organization is equal to the number of Windows 365 Frontline licenses that you’ve purchased. For example, if you purchase 10 licenses, 30 Cloud PCs will be provisioned. Ten of those Cloud PCs can be active at a given time. The licenses are managed automatically based on active sessions. When a user ends their session, the license is released for another user to start using their Cloud PC.

Windows 365 Frontline is in [public preview](../public-preview.md).

## Managing Windows 365 Frontline Cloud PCs
