# Edit on-premises network connection

All [on-premises network connections](on-premises-network-connections.md) (OPNC) are periodically checked to ensure that the environment is ready for use when provisioning Cloud PCs. If these [checks](health-checks.md) fail, you may need to need to fix your networking setup on Azure or edit one of the properties provided.

To edit an on-premises network connection:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Devices** > **Windows 365** (under **Provisioning**) > **On-premises network connection** > select the connection you want to edit > **Properties**.
2. For all OPNCs, you can edit the **General** settings by selecting **Edit** next to each header. You can edit all settings except **Join type**. For Hybrid Azure AD Join connections, you can also edit the **AD domain** settings.

After the edits have been saved, the OPNC checks are run to verify the configuration.

You cannot edit an OPNC if it is running checks. You must wait for the checks to pass/fail before edit functionality becomes available.
