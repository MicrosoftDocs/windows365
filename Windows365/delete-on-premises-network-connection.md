# Delete on-premises network connection

Only a unassigned on-premises network connection (OPNC) can be deleted. If an OPNC is in use by a provisioning policy, then you must do one of the following:

- Remove the OPNC from all provisioning policies.
- Delete the OPNC.

To delete an on-premises network connection:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Devices** > **Windows 365** (under **Provisioning**) > **On-premises network connection**.

2. Select the ellipses (**â€¦**) next to the connection you want to delete > **Delete**.
3. Select **Confirm** when asked to delete the connection.
