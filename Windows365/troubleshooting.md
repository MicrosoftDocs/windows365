# Troubleshooting

This article provides suggestions for troubleshooting Windows 365 issues.

## Contact help/support

For instructions on how to get help and open a support ticket, see  [How to get support in Microsoft Endpoint Manager](/mem/get-support.md). Support is included as part of your Windows 365 subscription.

Since Cloud PCs work like most physical devices, you can use existing troubleshooting documentation to troubleshoot issues with [Windows 10](/troubleshoot/windows-client/welcome-windows-client), [Microsoft 365 services](/microsoft-365/), and [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](/mem/get-support).

## Help users in your organization

You can use the Intune Troubleshooting page to view enrollment issues, remediation steps, and user details. For more information, see [Use the troubleshooting portal to help users at your company](/mem/intune/fundamentals/help-desk-operators).

[App Assure](https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack/microsoft-365/app-assure) is a service for Microsoft’s enterprise customers who encounter application compatibility issues. App Assure will help remediate issues with your ISV, line-of-business and Microsoft-developed apps at no additional cost. Follow the instructions above to submit a case if you encounter any app compatibility issues, and please include a short description of the issue you’re facing.

## On-premises network connections

For suggested remediations on, see [Troubleshoot on-premises network connections](troubleshoot-on-premises-network-connection.md).

## Provisioning issues

For suggested remediations on, see [Troubleshoot provisioning errors](provisioning-errors.md).

## Conditional access

Make sure that you apply conditional access policies to the dedicated Windows 365 cloud app in the conditional access UI of Microsoft EndpointM Manager admin center or Azure Active Directory. The Windows 365 cloud app includes the Azure Virtual Desktop cloud app.

Any conditional access policy that you apply will affect access to the end-user web portal and the connection to the Cloud PC from the Remote Desktop apps. For more information about service dependencies in Azure AD Conditional Access, see [Conditional Access service dependencies](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/service-dependencies).

Applying a more restrictive policy to Azure Virtual Desktop than the Windows 365 cloud app will result in Azure AD honoring the more restrictive policy. This will affect end user connectivity to their Cloud PCs after accessing the Windows 365 end user portal.

For more information on how a given policy may impact your environment, see [Troubleshoot using the What If tool in Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/what-if-tool).

## Networking

The [on-premises network connection checks](health-checks.md) help to make sure that network connectivity is working. Always retry the on-premises network connection if you suspect networking issues might be causing issues. Using the on-premises network connection checks will help to ensure that repeated and consistent checks are used as the first troubleshooting step.

Keep in mind that the on-premises network connection checks are validating the infrastructure configuration of your environment. They don't run checks to validate any additional configuration or applications deployed to Cloud PCs after provisioning by Microsoft Endpoint Manager or 3rd party agents. These agents or configurations can introduce additional issues that the on-premises network connection can't test for ahead of provisioning.

For example, if you deploy a VPN client to all devices in Microsoft Endpoint Manager, make sure that this client doesn’t:

- Break connectivity to Azure Virtual Desktop [endpoints required](requirements-network.md) by Windows 365.
- Exclude your Cloud PCs for having the VPN client deployed to them.

Finally, consider temporarily deploying a test Azure virtual machine to the Azure network subnet that you’re trying to provision or connect to your Cloud PCs. This will let you run all the network tests that you require from that network. You can use the PowerShell Test-NetConnection command to test connectivity on specific ports to specific network endpoints/URLs:

```Test-NetConnection <hostname> -Port 443```

## Troubleshooting by end users

The end user can troubleshoot some issues that might be preventing them from connecting to their Cloud PC. For more information, see [End-user actions](end-user-access-cloud-pc.md#end-user-actions)

## Audio and video redirection not working

For connections using the Remote Desktop client for Windows to access Cloud PCs, the first time a user logs on to their Cloud PC, Microsoft Teams will be installed.

After the installation, the optimizations to redirect audio and video to your local Windows endpoint don’t work. The user must close Teams and sign off from or restart the Cloud PC to activate the Optimized status.
