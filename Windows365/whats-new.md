Windows 365 is a new service from Microsoft that automatically creates Cloud PCs for your end users. Cloud PCs are a new hybrid personal computing category that use both the power of the cloud and the accessing device to provide a full and personalized Windows virtual machine. Admins can use Microsoft Endpoint Manager to define the configurations and applications that are provisioned for each user’s Cloud PC. End users can access their Cloud PC from any device and any location. Windows 365 stores the end user’s Cloud PC and data in the cloud, not on the device, providing a secure experience.

For more information about Windows 365, see [Windows 365](https://www.microsoft.com/windows-365?rtc=1).
