# What is NXT?

[!INCLUDE [MS confidential, draft docs](../includes/draft-doc.md)]

NXT is the first Cloud PC hardware device. Itâ€™s a full stack, purpose-built solution by Microsoft. When a users sign in to their NXT, they're securely connected to their [Cloud PC virtual machine](/windows-365/overview#what-is-a-cloud-pc) through the Windows 365 service.

Organizations can purchase NXTs and distribute them to their employees. Admins use Microsoft Intune to manage NXTs alongside other devices.

## Secure by design

NXT is secure by design, thanks to the following features:

- An adminless user model.
- No local data storage.
- No local apps.
- Arbitrary software can't be installed or executed on the NXT, so it's protected from malware.
- Security baseline policies are enabled by default.
- Security features can't be disabled.

## Requirements

Requirements for NXT include:

- NXT device.
- Management by your organization using Microsoft Intune.
- [Windows 365 license](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/windows-365?rtc=1) for your Cloud PC.
