# What is NXT?

[!INCLUDE [MS confidential, draft docs](../includes/draft-doc.md)]

NXT is the first Cloud PC device. It’s a full stack, purpose-built solution by Microsoft, designed to connect you to the Windows 365 service in seconds. When you sign in to your Cloud PC, you can securely connect to a familiar Windows Desktop in the cloud, and access a responsive, high-quality experience. For IT, it brings a more streamlined management experience, where it can be managed alongside other PCs in Microsoft Intune.

The device is secure by design, featuring an adminless user model, no local data storage, and no local apps. You can’t install or execute any arbitrary software on the device, so you are protected from malware. Security baseline policies are enabled by default, and security features cannot be disabled.

- keyboard
- mouse

### Ports and connections

On the front panel, there’s a USB-A port and a 3.5 mm audio jack. The back panel includes two USB-A ports, a USB-C port, an Ethernet port, and the power connector. It also includes an HDMI port and a Display Port—both the HDMI and Display Port support one monitor each, up to 4k in resolution. On the side, there is a Kensington lock port to help you physically secure the device. For wireless connectivity, the device supports Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3.
