# Sign in to, sign out, or lock your NXT

[!INCLUDE [MS confidential, draft docs](../includes/draft-doc.md)]

When you want to use the NXT, complete the following steps to sign in:

1. Power on the NXT.
2. On the **Sign in** screen, provide your sign in credentials. The device automatically presents you with the sign-in process configured by your organization (FIDO2 security key, Passkey (FIDO2), Microsoft Authenticator app, and so on).
3. Authenticate your account as requested.
4. You're connected to your Cloud PC with all of your context and apps just where you left off

## Sign out

To sign out of your NXT:

1. Press control-alt-delete.
1. Select **Sign out**.

## Lock or disconnect your NXT

Lock the device by either of these methods:

- Press the **Windows key + L** on your keyboard.
- Select **Start** > **Power** > **Lock**.
- In your Cloud PC, select ??start?? > **Power** > **Disconnect**.

The Cloud PC connection persists for 15 minutes (default) after sign-out. Your data and account information aren't stored on the NXT. If someone else signs into their account on the NXT, the previous user's Cloud PC connection is automatically disconnected.
