# Set up your NXT and sign in

[!INCLUDE [MS confidential, draft docs](../includes/draft-doc.md)]

The first time you turn on your NXT, you are guided through setting up your device, signing in with a work or school user account.

## Requirements

- An available network.
- A work or school account.

## First time set up

Complete the following steps to set up your new device:

1. Connect a monitor, USB mouse, and keyboard to the device.
2. Connect the power adaptor to the power port and then into a power outlet.
3. Power on the device.
4. On the **Let's connect you to a network** page, select a network > **Next**.

5. On the **Let's set things up for your work or school** page, type your work or school e-mail > **Next**

6. Authenticate your account as requested. Your organization defined the authentication method (security key, cross-device passkey, or passwordless multifactor authentication).
7. Your Cloud PC loads with all of your context and apps just where you left off.

You can adjust additional settings prior to sign-in by using [Quick settings](quick-settings.md) in the bottom-right corner.

When you sign in for the first time, the NXT joins Microsoft Entra and automatically enrolls the device into Microsoft Intune. You organization's admins use Intune to manage both virtual machines and hardware devices, including NXT.
