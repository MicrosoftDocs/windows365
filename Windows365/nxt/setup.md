# Set up your NXT and sign in

[!INCLUDE [MS confidential, draft docs](./includes/draft-doc.md)]

The first time you turn on your NXT, you are guided through setting up your device, signing in with a work or school user account.

## Requirements

- A work or school account.

## First time set up

Complete the following steps to set up your new device:

1. Connect a monitor, USB mouse, and keyboard to the device.
2. Connect the power adaptor to the power port and then into a power outlet.
3. Power on the device.
4. On the **Let's connect you to a network** page, select a network > **Next**.
5. On the **Please review License Agreement** page, review the agreement > **Next**.
6. On the **Let's set things up for your work or school** page, type your work or school e-mail > **Next**
7. On the **Sign in** page, type your work email address.

You can adjust additional settings prior to sign-in by using Quick settings in the bottom-right corner.
