For Frontline Cloud PCs in shared mode, you can [bulk reprovision](/windows-365/enterprise/remotely-manage-cloud-pc) all the Cloud PCs in a provisioning policy. Admins can also select the percentage of Cloud PCs that are available for users to connect without being impacted by reprovisioning process.
