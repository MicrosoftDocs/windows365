## Missing start menu and taskbar when using iPad and the Remote Desktop app to access a Cloud PC

When non-local admin users sign in to a Cloud PC by uinsg an iPad and the Microsoft Remote Desktop app, the start menu and task bar might be missing from the Windows 11 user interface.

**Troubleshooting steps**: Make sure that you have the latest version of Remote Desktop Client as found [here](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients).
In addition, you can also sign in to the Cloud PC by using [windows365.microsoft.com](https://windows365.microsoft.com).
