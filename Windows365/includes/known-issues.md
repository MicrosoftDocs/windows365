## Missing start menu and taskbar when using iPad and the Remote Desktop app to access a Cloud PC

When using an iPad and the Microsoft Remote Desktop app to sign in to a Cloud PC, non-local admin users might experience a Windows 11 user interface that is missing the start menu and taskbar.

**Troubleshooting steps**: Make sure that you have the latest version of Remote Desktop Client as found [here](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients).
In addition, you can also sign in to the Cloud PC by using [windows365.microsoft.com](https://windows365.microsoft.com).
