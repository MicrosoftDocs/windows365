# Get your users started with Cloud PCs

After licenses are assigned, let your users know that there are two different ways in which they can access their Cloud PCs:

- Windows 365 home page [(https://windows365.microsoft.com)](https://windows365.microsoft.com)
- Microsoft Remote Desktop client

## Windows 365 home page

Users can navigate to [https://windows365.microsoft.com](https://windows365.microsoft.com) to access their Cloud PCs.

On their Windows 365 home page, users see the Cloud PCs they have access to in the **Your Cloud PCs** section.

Users can select **Open in browser** to open their Cloud PC.

> [!NOTE]  
> Mobile devices aren’t currently supported for using a browser to open Cloud PC. The Remote Desktop app is supported.

### User actions

While on the Windows 365 home page, users can take actions on their Cloud PCs. To do so, they can select the gear icon on a Cloud PC card.
